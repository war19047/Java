# Overview

I thought it would be a good idea to learn how to use a HashMap in Java. HashMapâ€™s are essentially dictionaries with Key, Value pairs. The program I created used a HashMap to keep track of shopping items and their price. The user can enter from a series of menu choices to view, add, remove, or total the items in the shopping cart.

I have been working on improving my abilities in object-oriented programming. I decided to learn Java because the entire language is object oriented. Also, I think learning about Data Structures in different languages teaches a lot about how the programming language works.

# Development Environment

Getting the environment set up was a bit of a challenge. I used Visual Studio Code as my editor. VS Code does not come with any Java Compiler, so I had to install the JDK compiler and all the necessary extensions to compile Java code. 

Java has some very helpful libraries. Some of the libraries that I used are listed below.

* java.util.Scanner; - Allows for user input.
* java.util.HashMap; - Allows for use of a HashMap.
* java.util.Map; - Maps key value pairs.
* java.text.NumberFormat; - Used to format currency.
* java.util.Locale; - Used to obtain a geographic region. This paired with NumberFormat is used to format U.S. dollars.

# Future Work

* Read shopping cart items from a file or API.
* Robust error handling.
* Add the ability to save the shopping cart.
